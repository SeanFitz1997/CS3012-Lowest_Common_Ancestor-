# CS3012-Lowest_Common_Ancestor-
Python API used to identify the common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree or a more general DAG. 

## What's here
- LCA.py (The API file containing the node data structure and function to find LCA)
- test_LCA.py (Tests to ensure the API's correct functionality)

## Run Tests:
```
python test_LCA.py
```

## Important
* This implementation assumes that keys are unique in the binary tree or DAG.
